        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Dario Pullia and I'm a particle physics student currently studying in Milan. 
            I have a passion for software and coding, and in my free time I love to engage in sport climbing. <br><br>

            I've always been fascinated by the world of physics. As a student, I'm constantly learning and expanding my knowledge in this field, 
            and I often watch many YouTube channels to learn more about the latest developments in the field.<br><br>
            
            In addition to my passion for physics, I also have a strong interest in software and coding. I enjoy the challenges and problem-solving that come with creating and developing new software, and I often watch long tutorials on coding on YouTube to learn new skills and techniques.<br><br>
            
            In my free time, I love to engage in sport climbing. I find it to be a fun and challenging activity that helps keep me physically and mentally fit.<br><br>
            
            Overall, I'm a passionate and dedicated individual with a love for physics, software, and sport climbing. I'm excited to continue exploring these interests and seeing where they will take me in the future.<br><br>
